## Primary use cases

The model is designed for commercial and research use in all official 24 European languages.
Since it focuses on covering all 24 EU languages, it provides more stable results across these languages and better reflects European values in its answers than English-centric models. It is therefore specialized for use in multilingual tasks.

Primary use cases include:

- RAG (retrieval augmented generation) applications
- Summarizing texts
- Text generation
- Information extraction from texts
- Chatbot

The official 24 EU languages are:

Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish and Swedish.

## Out-of-Scope use cases

The model is not completely free from biases and hallucinations. It may generate content that is inappropriate, offensive, or harmful. While the dataset has been filtered to minimize such outputs, the model may still produce text that is biased or toxic due to the large scale and diverse nature of the data.

Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws) is prohibited.
Use in any other way than allowed by the Apache 2.0 license is prohibited.

Out-of-scope use cases include:

- Math tasks
- Coding tasks
- Use in languages that are not among the 24 EU languages
